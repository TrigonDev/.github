# Code of Conduct
These rules apply to all pull requests, issues, comments, and discussions for every repository in this organization.

## Rules
1. Do not try to impose your own believes on someone else.
2. Do not critisize other's believes or make jokes about them.
3. Don't be easily offended. Life is easiers (for you and everyone around) if you just let things go.
4. Do not use rule #3 as an excuse to offend someone or as a response to someone being offended. If you offended someone, apologize.
5. Don't try to enforce these rules (minimodding). That's the moderators' job.

## Punishments
Punishments are up to the moderators. These are just a general guideline.
1. Private warning.
2. Temporary ban.
3. Really long temporary ban.
4. Really *really* long temporary ban.
5. 80 year "temporary" lifetime ban (jk).
