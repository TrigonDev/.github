TrigonDev is an organization owned solely by [Circuit](https://github.com/CircuitSacul) (though there may be other contributors to projects). This organization primarily contains Discord bots and libraries for them, using the following external tools and libraries:
 - [python](https://python.org), because it's just the best programming language,
 - [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for package management (virtual environments, dependency resolver, ditch setuptools, etc.),
 - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) for the database backend,
 - [hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari), which is a wrapper around Discord's API, and
 - [hikari-crescent](https://github.com/magpie-dev/hikari-crescent), which is a command handler for Hikari.


If you need support, you can contact me `CircuitSacul#3397` by **joining this server** https://discord.gg/dGAzZDaTS9. I don't accept friend requests.
