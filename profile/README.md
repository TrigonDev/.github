TrigonDev is an organization owned solely by [Circuit](https://github.com/CircuitSacul) (though there may be other contributors to projects). This organization primarily contains Discord bots and libraries for them. The examples and templates primarily use the following:
 - [python](https://python.org), because it's just the best programming language,
 - [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for package management (virtual environemnts, dependency resolver, ditch setuptools, etc.),
 - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) for the database backend,
 - [hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari), which is a wrapper around Discord's API, and
 - [tanjun](https://github.com/FasterSpeeding/Tanjun), which is a command framework for hikari.
